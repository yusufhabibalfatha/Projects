# Blogger mini-project
This application is a mini blogger, its features are posting, editing posts, and deleting posts. It's very simple, what I made aims to write about the technicalities in writing programs that I often forget but are important. So I am interested in creating a blog in mini form.


## Desktop view
<img src="./screenshots/ss-desktop-home.jpg" width=50%> <img src="./screenshots/ss-desktop-blog.jpeg" width=50%> <img src="./screenshots/ss-desktop-edit-blog.jpeg" width=50%> <img src="./screenshots/ss-desktop-post-blog.jpeg" width=50%>
The appearance is also very simple because to make the user focus on some writing in the middle of the screen and the blog content must only be the point.


## Mobile view
<img src="./screenshots/ss-mobile-home.jpg" width=30%> <img src="./screenshots/ss-mobile-blog.jpeg" width=30%> <img src="./screenshots/ss-mobile-edit-blog.jpeg" width=30%> <img src="./screenshots/ss-mobile-post-blog.jpeg" width=30%>
## Final
From this application I learned about a CRUD system in a database and also inputting long text and making complex applications that can look simple.
